# Applying Hierarchical Clustering On Wholesale Reseller Data

Hierarchical Clustering is an algorithm to group data points on the basis of their similarity. 
Wholesale Market Data is data from a distributor about the way they distribute various goods and the revenue generated from it. 
Our aim was to find similarity between such resellers based on their buying patterns. While there are various different choices 
to make when deciding to implement it, we did our analysis with four different distance measures - single, complete, average and centroid.
We also used two different distance measures - euclidean and correlational. We finally concluded with analysis of various Dendrograms 
and inferences from them.
